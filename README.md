# About this Repo

This repo is a copy of the  [official Postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/postgres/) modified to run on top of CentOS 7 instead of Debian

All the instructions of the official image still apply here

The actual Docker image is hosted in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hilikus/postgres/) in the repository `hilikus/postgres`
